# 📊 Data Analyst Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Data Analyst Projects** repo!  
This is a collection of hands-on projects showcasing how I use **Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Excel** to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** → Handling missing values, formatting dates, feature engineering.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Discovering insights through grouping, filtering, and statistical summaries.  
- **Data Visualization** → Creating meaningful charts (bar, line, scatter, histograms, heatmaps) using Matplotlib.  
- **Excel Integration** → Exporting clean datasets and automated reports for business users.  
- **Case Studies** → End-to-end projects (like HR analytics, sales insights, customer trends, etc.).
